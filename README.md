The importance of selecting a wine to pair with food makes or breaks the flavor combination. With so many options for different types of white and red wines, we are giving you an inside look at the quality of wine and what truly contributes to choosing the better quality. We will be analyzing different traits in both white and red wine such as alcohol content, sugar levels, acidity, color, etc. to gain a better understanding on how each contributes to the quality.


                                                      Project Breakdown: 

Cleaning the data: Carolina

Tableau Graphing: Julia

HTML/CSS/Bootstrap Web-page display: Julia 

Python Pandas/Matplotlib graphing & code layout: Anna

Deployment to Heroku: Group Effort

Powerpoint Presentation of data: Group Effort


For this project we will be using the Scikit-Learn Python Machine learning program. In addition to this program we will also be implementing the use of Tableau (for graphing), HTML/CSS/Bootstrap (for web display of data), Python Pandas/Matplotlib (for code layout and graphs), and finally Heroku for the host application. 
Various graph types will be used to visually represent findings.
